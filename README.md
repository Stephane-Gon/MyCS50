# MyCS50
My experience at CS50

Here I post my code while doing CS50 course, which I want to tank for the amazing course and for their hard work.

Week 1:

 1º Hello, world program
 2º A program that takes input from the user and creates a pyramid with "#" depending on the user's input
 3º The same thing has problem 2 but instead of one pyramid they asked for two pyramids back to back with a small gap.
 4º A program that takes user's input for a number and than gives the amount of change that would be in certain coins.
 5º A program that checks if a credit card number given by the user it's real or fake.

Week 2:
 
 1º Implement a program that computes the approximate grade level needed to comprehend some text.
 2º Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.
